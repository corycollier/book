## Plot

Takes place in > 3000AD

Computer AI is a co-existing species

Deep space travel is still not-existant. Years of global war have stifled major space travel advancements.

4 major factions fight for control of Earth.

Earth's resources have gone through periods of major decline. These
periods have been met with mankind adopting strategies to use
different resources.

Conflicts usually happen at border areas. The 4 major factions each have relatively peaceful city areas.

Male humans average 7ft tall. Females average 6ft tall. Most people are not purely biological. Most opt for cybernetic enhancements. These are typically for vanity.

In city centers, the populace doesn't "work". The AI of each faction handles the management of daily affairs, and allows people the freedom to do as they please.

Power distribution comes from satellites in space, that transmit solar generated power to receivers in earth. From there, the power is transmitted to subsequent devices.

The world is post-dystopian. During periods of resource overusage, the earth went through times of barrenness. Those memories are harsh, and steer the decision making of leaders in each of the 4 factions. Each of the major factions has performed some type of re-terraforming their land. Some have had more success than others.

Colonies do exist on both Mars and Venus.

Martian colonies are land based, and terraforming efforts are underway. However, the 3 factions doing this haven't been able to invest as much in these efforts to allow for significant progress

1 faction has a Venetian colony. It is completely cloud based. It sits 50km above the harsh conditions at the surface of the planet.

Beacuse only 1 faction has colonized Venus, warring never occurs there. Small skirmishes have broken out on Mars. One of them being severe.
